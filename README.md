# Transfer Learning Between Different Games via Generative Models #
1. The [OpenAI-Request for Research 2.0.pdf](https://github.com/hamzafar/transfer_learning_games/blob/main/OpenAI-Request%20for%20Research%202.0.pdf) file describe the reserach problem and the results produced.

2. The Transfomer [Attention Is All You Need](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7181-attention-is-all-you-need.pdf) is coded in tensorflow with necessary changes to train it to [Atari Games](https://gym.openai.com/)

  1. The jupyter notebook [Transformer.ipynb](https://github.com/hamzafar/transfer_learning_games/blob/main/Transformer.ipynb) cotains all code for implementation of the   Customized Transormer

3. The [Deep Q-Network](https://web.stanford.edu/class/psych209/Readings/MnihEtAlHassibis15NatureControlDeepRL.pdf) is used for generating Games Data.
